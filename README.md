# AI-Student-Grader
Using OpenAI's o3-mini model to grade student chat data from an application called 'Mr. Kato'; a virtual AI patient which they can chat with to develop their clinical skills.

This code takes conversation data, and chains multiple API calls to grade students in 4 different sections following a pre-made rubric. This was a prototype which was planned to be incorporated into the application after they finish their chat.

Due to the way the API calls were chained, it only took around 15 seconds per student and cost $0.04 per evaluation in API usage.
